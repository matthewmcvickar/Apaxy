# Apaxy

My personal modification of Adam Whitcroft's [Apaxy](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/Apaxy).

## Notable Differences

- The `.htaccess` files are hidden by default.
- The `theme` folder is renamed `.apache-theme` so that its purpose is more clear and it stays hidden in the Finder.
- The default font is Helvetica Neue instead of Open Sans.
- The favicon is specified, removing the need for a `favicon.ico` to sit in the webroot.
- Footer example text and branding removed.

## Wishlist

- Retina-ready icons.
